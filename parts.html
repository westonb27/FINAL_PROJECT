                <h2>Parts List and Diagram</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Processor: I chose the processor because it's the most recent and has overclocking capability. I really wanted to get off of the AMD chipsets and move to the more powerful Intel 1151 socket for future upgradability as well.</li>
                    <li>CPU Cooler: It's a generic choice, but I really chose it for aesthetics. I was stuck between this and the H80i, but I ended up going with this because I like that the radiator covers the entire front of the case from the side panel. I also really like the RGB LED on the block.</li>
                    <li>Motherboard: I picked the mobo because I wanted to get the best of the best. Asus has so many features and the BiOS is pretty slick too. I was stuck between this and the Gigabyte Z170 Gaming-5 mATX board. I chose this one because I like the way it looks, I wanted the features, and I have the money for it.</li>
                    <li>Memory: I was cheap memory. It does what it does for the right price so I picked it.</li>
                    <li>Storage: I chose the Samsung 950 Pro becuase it's unbelieveably fast. It isn't the biggest capacity, but it's only there for boot and my main programs.</li>
                    <li>Storage: The Samsung 840 evo is from my old PC and I figured I could always use more flash storage.</li>
                    <li>Storage: The WD Blue 2.5in I got it from my dad's laptop. It saved me $50 on buying a new WD Blue drive. It's for general purpose storage of videos, documents, music and photos.</li>
                    <li>Video Card: The 970 is a good budget card with awesome performance. When I was picking a manufacturers, I learned that MSI and Asus cards had heat pipes that wouldn't make clearance for the case I chose. Since I didn't want to compromise on the case, I decided to look at reference or EVGA. Found a good card within my budget and there you have it.</li>
                    <li>Case: I love this case. The aesthetics of it are a perfect fit for me. I wanted to build something small, but not a tower. I wanted a cube and this is the one that piqued my interest the most. I really like the dual chamber design and how well air flows through it. Becuause I'll be living in a small room on my college campus, I think that's important.</li>
                    <li>Power Supply: Power supplies are pretty easy to get ahold. I wanted something solid with enough power for use in future builds or upgrading this one later.</li>
                </ul>
